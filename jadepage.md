## 2022 at a Glance 

- This past April I was able to earn my Aggie Ring. This day was near and dear to my heart as both a first-generation Aggie and a first-generation college student.
- This past summer I interned for BNSF Logisitcs in their HR Department and I plan to return to the company this coming January.
- I am currently enrolled in a Technology Management course called [TCMG 412](https://catalog.tamu.edu/search/?P=TCMG%20412)
